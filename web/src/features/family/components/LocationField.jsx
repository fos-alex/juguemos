/**
 * Where the family lives, in the family form (JUG-25). It is read for one
 * thing: what the weather is like there, so a juego outside comes up on a
 * good afternoon and one inside when it rains. A city or a zone is all it
 * needs, so nothing here asks for a street, and the app never asks the phone
 * where it is.
 *
 * Unlike the family's own names, this is a public place, so the keyboard is
 * left to correct and capitalise it.
 *
 * Ludi looks the words up when they are saved. When it found nothing the
 * field says so plainly, since the weather is invisible and the parent has no
 * other way of knowing it isn't being read for them. The line goes as soon as
 * they write something else.
 * @param {{
 *   location: string | null,
 *   saved: import('../types').Location | null,
 *   onChange: (location: string) => void,
 * }} props `saved` is where the family last saved, and whether it was found
